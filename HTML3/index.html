          A lake is a naturally occurring, relatively large body of water
          localized in a basin surrounded by dry land.[1] A lake generally has a
          slower-moving flow than the inflow or outflow stream(s) that serve to
          feed or drain it.[2] Lakes lie completely on land and are separate
          from the ocean, although, like the much larger oceans, they form part
          of the Earth's water cycle by serving as large standing pools of
          storage water. Most lakes are freshwater
